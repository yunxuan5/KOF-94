 1) Manually instantiated XPM_CDC modules: Xilinx recommends that you remove these modules. 
 2) Xilinx IP that contains XPM_CDC modules: Verify the connections to the IP to determine whether you can safely ignore this message.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
