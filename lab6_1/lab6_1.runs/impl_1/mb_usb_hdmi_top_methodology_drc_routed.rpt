Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock mb_block_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin mb_block_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

DPIR-1#1 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP color_instance/bg1_rom_address0 input pin color_instance/bg1_rom_address0/A[0] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.

Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities

The latch color_instance/char2_stand_addr_reg[7] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin color_instance/char2_stand_addr_reg[7]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#169 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch color_instance/char2_stand_addr_reg[8] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin color_instance/char2_stand_addr_reg[8]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#170 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch color_instance/char2_stand_addr_reg[9] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin color_instance/char2_stand_addr_reg[9]/G is not reached by a timing clock
